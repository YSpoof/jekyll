# To do :

Centralize all things, e.g:

--------------------------------------------------
        LightAsHell                 Menu

                    Home
                    Posts:
                        Post A
                        Post B

        Footer need to be centered as well

--------------------------------------------------


And hope for nothing bad to happens


Ah, we could also try to add images

Then IG we can move to the more "advanced" stuff, e.g

Forms ( yes, I know, we need to find a service to receive these "POST" requests | or host our own ( I've no idea on how to BTW ))
More "true dynamic" features
