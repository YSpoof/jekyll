Edit all files inside _includes to optimize and improve the layout

head.html
header.html
body.html
footer.html

After that we need to append the Jekyll(Liquid) stuff so the page is generated "dynamically"

like {% page.title %} etc...

Also we need to tweak and adapt the _layouts/default.html and _layouts/post.html so we have a default global layout and a posts one, maybe we can also create one for pages, I dunno...
